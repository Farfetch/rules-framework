# glyphicons-only-bootstrap

Bootstrap nicely offers a functionality for a user to customize their bootstrap package source ([Official link](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=76290a4e23bf2c3f61a4e17625be4627)). However, even if we customize it, there still is a normalize.css part in it. For some users who don't want use normalize.css out of bootstrap, it could be a annoyting part. Thus, I deleted the normalize.css part and this glyphicons-only-bootstrap contains only pure glyphicon parts.


## Installation
