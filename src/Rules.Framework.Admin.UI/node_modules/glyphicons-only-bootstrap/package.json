  "description": "Glyphicons-only-bootstrap contains only glyphicon components out of entire Bootstrap. Even if Bootstrap allows a functionality to customize their source code, the source always comes up with normalize.css. For some users who do not want to use normalize.css in Bootstrap, I deleted normalize.css part and this package provides only glyphicons!"
